Things to add to the board:

MAIN MCU - DONE
USB C POWER -
I2C Accelerometer -
I2C Gyroscope (Check Price) -   
UART TO USB C (ambishious, optional) -

    100n (etc) cap on each power pin to ground

    Connect all the power pins to a 3.3V etc line. VDD*, VBAT etc

    Connect all ground AKA VSS pins to ground.

    Connect the SWDIO, SWCLK, and NRST pins to a header you can connect to an ST-LINK. Probably also a 3v3 and ground pin on that header.

    100n cap between nrst and ground.

    Connect HSE and LSE crystals if you want.

    Wire Boot0 to ground, or to a button that lets you momentarily connect it high.

    HSE Crystal freq can be whatever, as long as it's MHz order of magnitude. It's optional, depending on your use case. LSE freq must be 32.768kHz.

    You can do either, but the dongle will make debugging much easier.

    Check the RM and datasheet. 3v3 is fine. So is lower and higher, but I don't remember how much.
