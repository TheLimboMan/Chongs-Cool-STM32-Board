# Chongs-Cool-STM32-Board

This is my own custom STM32F411CEU6 Board made as an exercise for learning how to make proper PCB boards

This board contains 3 buttons, a MPU-6050 connected up through I2C, USB-C connector for power and data, and in total 12 GPIO pins

Everything is work in progress at the moment
## Roadmap

- Write the appropriate firmware

- Write documentation for said firmware

- Add Example programs
